# Database description

The main idea is to develop a website that aims at connecting people, local communities and restaurants who are willing to donate the excess food, with the needy and provide them food. The data that has to be stored in the database includes donor details, receiver details, type of food available, location of the people in need, food preference, amount of food needed, contact numbers of the donors, time at which the food is needed, dispatch time etc. Food delivery applications like Uber Eats, GrubHub, DoorDash and shopping applications like Walmart, Amazon etc., can use this database to help the cause. There are some applications which serve this purpose but the major difference is that these applications focus on restaurants and NGOs mainly, but we plan to establish a a direct connection between the donor and the receiver. The donor can be a community, restaurant or even a single person.
