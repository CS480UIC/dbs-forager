### First normal form - </br>
All non-key columns of our tables depend on the primary keys. Hence the tables do not have any duplicate rows. 


### Second Normal form -</br>
None of the tables in our database have composite keys hence the tables are automatically in second normal form by definition.


### Third normal form- </br>
All non key columns of all the tables strictly depend on their respective primary keys. Hence the tables have been normalized to third normal form.


### Boyce-Codd normal form- </br>
The tables are reduced to Boyce-Codd normal form since all non key columns depend on their respective primary keys and the primary keys are unique.
